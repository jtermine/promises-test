// This is an example of how to use the new low level WebSockets APIs introduced in ASP.NET 4.5.
// In practice we expect that few developers will need to use these low level APIs and will instead use the 
// [Microsoft.WebSockets](http://nuget.org/List/Packages/Microsoft.WebSockets) NuGet package.
//
// The function of this handler is simple. It receive text messages over the WebSocket connection, appends "You said "
// to the front of the message and sends it back over the WebSocket connection.
//
// This handler takes advantage of the new asynchrony features in C# 5. Explaining these features is beyond the scope of this documentation -

        //### Accepting the connection
        // If the incoming request is a valid WebSocket request then accept the request and use the `HandleWebSocket` method to handle the WebSocket 
        // connection. Defining a seperate method (`HandleWebSocket` in this case) isn't necessary but it helps with readability by reducing the amount of code nesting.

        // When a WebSocket connection request is accepted, `HandleWebSocket` is invoked and ASP.NET passes in an instance of `WebSocketContext`. The `WebSocketContext`
        // class captures relevant information available at the time of the request. For example:
        //
        // * `WebSocketContext.RequestUri` is the Uri used to establish the WebSocket connection. This might include query string parameters.
        // * `WebSocketContext.CookieCollection` contains any cookies that were included in the connection request.               
        //
        // `WebSocketContext` is a read-only type - you cannot perform any actual IO operations such as sending or receiving using the `WebSocketContext`. These operations 
        // can be performed by accessing the `System.Net.WebSocket` instance via the `WebSocketContext.WebSocket` property.
